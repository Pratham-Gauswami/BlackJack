# BlackJack Game

## Project Overview

This is a **BlackJack** game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game follows the classic rules of BlackJack, allowing users to play against the dealer. Itâ€™s designed to run entirely in the browser with an intuitive and responsive user interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play the traditional BlackJack game against the dealer.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts to various screen sizes, making it playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Card Shuffling Algorithm**: The deck of cards is shuffled to ensure randomness in gameplay.
- **Real-time Score Updates**: Track your score and the dealer's score in real-time.
- **Multiple Actions**: Hit, stand, and see results dynamically during the game.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Press the "Start Game" button to shuffle the cards and begin.
2. **Hit or Stand**: The player can choose to "Hit" (draw a card) or "Stand" (hold their current hand).
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The goal is to get as close to 21 without going over.
   - If your score exceeds 21, you lose (bust).
   - The dealer also draws cards and aims to beat your score without busting.
4. **Game Ends**: When either the player or dealer wins (or a tie), the game resets for a new round.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure and layout of the game.
- **CSS**: To style the game elements and make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the game logic, such as card shuffling, scoring, and dealer behavior.
